# Nix interface to go.mod for maneater. Pure-consumer half of the
# flake-input-go_mod protocol (amarbel-llc/nixpkgs RFC 0001).
#
# Routes the cross-amarbel-llc go.mod `require` lines onto their
# producer flakes' go-pkgs outputs, collapsing the three-place
# lockstep (go.mod pseudo-version + gomod2nix.toml NAR hash + flake.lock
# rev) into a single source: each producer's flake.lock entry.
#
# Threaded through every buildGoApplication and mkGoEnv call site in
# flake.nix — a missing call site silently resurrects the lockstep
# regression class (amarbel-llc/madder#208 / #211 / #213).
